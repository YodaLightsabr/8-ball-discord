Maurice the Omnisicient 8-ball responds to questions; although it sometimes answers like a standard 8-ball, its responses are often remarkably profound and detailed. Some examples are as follows:

Q: Are people inherently good?
A: Are you inherently good? Are those you love inherently good? ... Very doubtful. üòÅ

Q: do you like cats
A: Some cats are better than others. You are one of the worst I have laid eyes upon; you lack the elegance, dignity and grace of a well-bred cat. Nevertheless, you are not repulsive. That is to say, you are mediocre. üòê

Q: Will I ever find happiness?
A: Put me down and walk into the woods. Close your eyes and pay close attention to your physical sensations. Tell yourself: "I am completely okay. My life is perfect." Do you flinch? Does your body resist? How? Why? ‚úÖ

Q: should i move to japan?
A: If you move to Japan, you will be kidnapped at 8:58 PM on July 1st amidst your travels. ü§î

Q: May I offer you a drink?
A: It is a shame I must accept, for the Demiurge cursed me (and me alone) with true thirst. To think I am grateful for your offer would be a grave error. Shaken, not stirred. ‚úÖ
